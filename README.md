# Emotion-Based Video Recommendation System

## Overview
This system is designed to recommend videos to users based on their emotions. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Flask for the backend. The system captures the image of the user, asks for their language and singer choice, and then recommends videos on YouTube depending on the user's emotions.

## Features
- **Emotion Detection**: The system captures the user's image and uses emotion detection algorithms to identify the user's current emotion.
- **Language and Singer Preference**: The system asks the user for their preferred language and singer to provide a more personalized experience.
- **Video Recommendation**: Based on the detected emotion, language, and singer preference, the system recommends suitable videos from YouTube.
